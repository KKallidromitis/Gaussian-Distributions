# Gaussian Distributions #
This repository is part of the coursework for the Machine Learning Foundations module at University of Southampton. It is a mathematical approach to investigate the behaviour of data in the form of two dimensional Gaussian Distributions. In addition, Fischers Linear Discriminant ratio is used to classify them while varying the mean and covariance matrices.
